Features I want to add:
Present:
- Improving search
	- Search when enter is pressed
	- Block search button while search loading
	- Prevent enter from launching search while search loading
- Loading preset
	- Loading preset search value to search bar
	- Loading the actual preset results from search history
- Set preset to current search results when set preset is pressed
- Add viewing history
	- Load complete history of search titles (scrollable)
	- Change UI to show search title and how long it was searched from current time 
	  (minutes, hours, days, weeks, months (max) ago)
	- Load search results for particular search query when clicked on
- Improve on storage:
	- change json file management based on json file size (if file is too large)
	- when done with file management, update the search_history... json file with empty items
	- Include test data (what I experimented with)

Future:
- Option to load preset results
- Load previous results if quit extension accidentally
- Being able to navigate searches (previous and next)
- Implement sessions
	- Keep history for currently running session only
	- Clear up search history once session is ended (except for preset)
	- Once new session is started, on launch, load preset results (in front end, it will load preset instead of previous search)

Completed features:
- Initial extension features:
	- Launch extension UI on click
	- Perform search on youtube in headless once extension is loaded
	- Load titles from search to the extension's UI

- Improve search results:
	- Show title description on hover
	- Link to youtube video on clicking title

- Add search feature:
	- Adding search bar that can perform search
	- perform search on clicking search icon

- Add menu feature:
	- Add menu bar button that loads and closes menu page
	- Show different sections of menu (set preset, view history, history)
